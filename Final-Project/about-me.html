            About Me
        </h2>
        <p><img src="images/Myself.jpg" class="self-picture" alt="A selfie pf me">Hello to everyone viewing this page, My name is Roberto Carlos Colmenares Hernandez and I am currently enrolled at wake tech for a degree in Web Development. I am 21 years old and I was born and raised in Raleigh North Carolina. I enjoy web design because it combines the fun you get when creating something that you feel is enjoyable with the trial and error method of coding. Another reason I really enjoy web design is because when I started this course, I started noticing other design choices from other websites and I always thought how it was interesting that other websites have layouts and their color choices. A few languages that I am proficient at are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        I am a Mexican American student that enjoys to listen to music, going out and trying new things to eat, going out on walks, and playing video games on my PC that I built during the pandemic. A few artist/bands that I enjoy listening to are <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/artist/blood-orange-mn0002661535/biography?1682981126804" target="_blank">Blood Orange</a>, <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tame-impala-mn0002014409/biography" target="_blank">Tame Impala</a>, and <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/artist/king-krule-mn0002814183/biography" target="blank">King Krule</a>. Some foods i really enjoy are Crab Cakes, anything with lamb, any type of rice, and carrot cake. Some of my favorite games to play on PC are Risk of Rain 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Elden Ring.
